## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The website embraces a **"Cultural Modernity"** approach – combining traditional Indian design elements with contemporary web design principles:

- **Color Palette**: Inspired by the Indian flag (saffron, white, green) with modern gradients
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts that work across all devices
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace for a clean, uncluttered feel
- **Interactions**: Subtle animations that enhance rather than distract
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and keyboard navigation support
